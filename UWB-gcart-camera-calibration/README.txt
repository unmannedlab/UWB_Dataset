This folder contains the calibration stuff for the first golfcart used for the UWB project.

UWB_gcart_camchain.yaml contains the camera chain and the intrinsic and extrinsic matrices for the front three cameras. 

UWB_gcart_rearcam-camchain.yaml contains the intrinsics for the rear camera.


All calibration was performed using Kalibr. I have included the bag files for each of the camera sets here.

The target used was an aprilgrid, the characterisitics of which are described in aprilgrid.yaml.



The folder has all the data you would need, should you want to try the calibration using Kalibr yourself.

You can find Kalibr here:   https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr.git
